# MaryAnn Nwagor | Personal Portfolio Website

This is a modern, responsive, and lightweight personal portfolio built using **only HTML and CSS**. The website showcases my skills, background, achievements, projects, and contact information—all wrapped in a beautifully designed and mobile-first layout.

This project was built as part of a **Portfolio Building Hackathon Challenge**, with constraints to avoid libraries & frameworks. It demonstrates creative design and responsiveness using vanilla technologies.
